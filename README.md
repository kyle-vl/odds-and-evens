# Odds and Evens (Hand Game)

Each player decides to play odds or evens. Then both players simultaneously show any number of fingers from 0 to 5, and the winner is the player that correctly predicted the total (odd or even) for that round. 

Although this is usually played between two players, I've implemented a system that you can play against with an easy, medium, and hard difficulty. For higher difficulties, the computer will try to learn the behaviour of the human player and attempt to guess the playerâ€™s next move.
